# Popular Movies

Android application that allows users to discover the currently most popular and highly rated movies. Contains details for each movie including, synposis, rating, trailers, and reviews. Users can add movies to their favorites list to keep track of them, which also makes the movies and all their details available offline.

This project was built from scratch as part of Udacity's [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) program.

## Usage

This application uses information fetched from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/), so you must provide your own API key to build this app. After cloning the repository, add your own gradle.properties file to the project's root containing your API key using the following name: TMDB_API_KEY= (insert key as String here).
